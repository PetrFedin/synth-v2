# Syntha V2

Standalone fashion B2B operating platform for brands, retailers, distributors and production partners.

Syntha V2 combines and extends the strongest operating patterns of JOOR, NuORDER, Brandboom, Centra and adjacent platforms without copying proprietary implementations.

The legacy `PetrFedin/syntha` repository remains unchanged; this repository is the independent home of all further Syntha V2 development.

## Executable core

`Campaign → Collection → Showroom → Selection → Order Builder → Order → Confirmation → DealSpace`

The current system includes PostgreSQL-owned authentication, organisation RBAC, partner access, digital showrooms, server-authoritative catalog pricing, MOQ and ATS controls, atomic inventory reservations, bilateral confirmation, order cancellation with inventory release, DealSpace, calendar milestones, notifications, OpenAPI and a standalone web workspace.

## Interface languages

The web workspace supports Russian and English. The `RU / EN` switch is available before authentication and inside the workspace. The selected locale is persisted in the browser and controls navigation, forms, statuses, dates, numbers and fallback UI messages without reloading the application.

All new user-facing text must be routed through `public/modules/i18n-runtime.js`. `npm run validate:i18n` verifies dictionary integrity, browser execution order, locale persistence, static delivery and critical UI action wiring.

## Product direction

Digital linesheets and buyer collaboration; assortment planning, budgets, doors and size curves; wholesale CRM and payments; style/color/size catalog; PLM, BOM and samples; production, QC, logistics and landed cost; analytics and integration APIs.
